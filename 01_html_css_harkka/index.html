                    <p>Shin Megami Tensei II is a post-apocalyptic role-playing video game developed and published by
                        Atlus. It was originally released for the Super Famicom in 1994 in Japan, and has since been
                        ported to multiple platforms. It is the second game in the Shin Megami Tensei series, which is a
                        subset of the larger Megami Tensei franchise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The gameplay comprises first-person exploration of dungeons and battles against demons; the
                        player can also choose to speak to the demons, and attempt to recruit them to their party. By
                        fusing multiple allied demons together, the player can create more powerful demons. The story is
                        set decades after the first Shin Megami Tensei, in the encapsulated city Tokyo Millennium, which
                        is ruled by the religious Messians from a unit called the Center. The player takes the role of a
                        gladiator who is told that he is the Messiah, and is sent on missions around Tokyo Millennium to
                        eradicate demons and prepare for the Thousand-Year Kingdom. The plot is influenced by choices
                        the player makes throughout the game, determining their moral alignment.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                    <p>
                        In Shin Megami Tensei II, the player takes the role of the gladiator Hawk, who is able to
                        communicate with demons. The gameplay is similar to that of the first Shin Megami Tensei:
                        the game is controlled from a first-person view, and has the player exploring dungeons and
                        navigating outdoor areas, which are presented as 2D maps seen from a top-down perspective. In
                        both these types of areas, the player encounters and battles against demons; a gauge on
                        the bottom of the screen shows the likelihood of a demon encounter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The player is able to speak to demons instead of fighting them, and can try to form an alliance
                        with
                        them; these negotiations involve the player trying to increase the demon's mood, and start with
                        the player picking an attitude – friendly or intimidating – after which they get to choose how
                        to
                        respond to what the demon says or does, and whether to give the demon items or money it asks
                        for.
                        Demons act differently depending on their personality, as well as the in-game phase of the moon;
                        it
                        is impossible to converse with demons during full moon, forcing the player to fight or flee.
                        Depending on choices the player makes throughout the game, their moral alignment changes; the
                        different alignments are "law", "chaos", and "neutrality". These affect how the plot progresses,
                        and how easy or difficult it is to form alliances with certain demon types, depending on how
                        compatible the player's and the demon's alignments are.
                    </p>
                    <p>The player can acquire stronger demons by fusing two or three allied demons together, resulting in a
                        single, predetermined type of demon; there is however a small chance that a "fusion accident"
                        occurs, resulting in a demon other than the type the fusion was thought to produce. Fused demons can
                        "inherit" abilities from the demons used to create it, including ones a demon of its type normally
                        would be unable to have. Demons can also be fused with weapons to create powerful swords for
                        the player to use.
