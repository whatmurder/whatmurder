        <p class="p2">Once upon a time, Satan was an angel in heaven, known as Lucifer. He was the most beautiful and
            powerful of all the angels, and he was also the most proud. Satan grew envious of God's power and decided
            that he wanted to be like God, so he led a rebellion against God and was cast out of heaven along with the
            angels who followed him.
            Satan and his followers landed on Earth, where they became known as demons. Satan, now known as the Devil,
            became the ruler of the underworld and continues to tempt and deceive human beings to this day. He is often
            portrayed as the enemy of God and the embodiment of evil.
            However, Satan's power is limited, and his ultimate defeat is promised in religious texts. But, Satan still
            continues to tempt and deceive people, trying to lead them astray from the path of righteousness.
            This is the most common story about Satan in many religions and cultures.

            In different religious and mythological accounts, the character of Satan, or the Devil, is often depicted as
            a symbol of temptation, sin, and evil. He is said to be constantly at odds with the forces of good and
            righteousness, working to lead humanity away from the path of virtue. The Devil's methods of temptation can
            vary, but they often involve sowing doubt, inciting desires, and exploiting human weaknesses.
            While Satan is portrayed as a formidable adversary, religious texts also frequently emphasize the idea that
            his power is limited and that he will ultimately be defeated. Various religious traditions offer different
            perspectives on the final outcome of this cosmic battle between good and evil.
            For example, in Christianity, it is believed that Satan's ultimate defeat is foretold in the Book of
            Revelation. According to this interpretation, Satan will be cast into the lake of fire, marking the end of
            his reign of deception and temptation. In Islam, there is a similar expectation of the Devil's eventual
            defeat, with the Day of Judgment playing a central role in his ultimate downfall.
            Throughout history, artists, writers, and theologians have explored and interpreted the character of Satan
            in numerous ways, creating a rich tapestry of literature, art, and cultural representations. The Devil's
            enduring presence in human storytelling and mythology reflects our fascination with the eternal struggle
            between good and evil and the moral choices we face as individuals.
